== Foreword
Thanks to everyone that was part of the BB community.

== Introduction
GoBBS is a forum server with a browser client.
I started it because I like https://www.phpbb.com/[phpBB]
but I don't enjoy installing, configuring, and securing
PHP on servers.

== Specifications

=== Registration creates a new user
As a bulletin board operator,
I want to register new users,
so that they can read posts.

==== Registration should generate a link to complete the account setup
Given that a user wants an account
and I have the user's e-mail address,
when I register the user,
then the system should e-mail the user a link
and allow the user to add a password and handle to the account.

==== Links should not be reusable
Given that a user has visited the link
when the link is visited again,
then the system should deny access.
